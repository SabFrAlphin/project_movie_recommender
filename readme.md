# MOVIE RECOMMENDER (NMF, collaborative filtering)
## Recommender System with Collaborative filtering algorithm (MovieLens 100k dataset)

- MovieLens dataset - a classic dataset for training recommendation models.
- It can be obtained from the GroupLens website.
- There are various datasets, but the one that I will use below consists of 100,000 movie ratings by users (on a 1-5 scale).
- The main data file consists of a tab-separated list with user-id (starting at 1), item-id (starting at 1), rating, and timestamp as the four fields.


## Objective:
The project consists of the following stages:

- Explore the data in jupyter notebook
- create a simple html/css website to get user user_input
- transform user input and calculate recommentation
